# Meme-Classifier
This is a CNN code for classifying a photo as meme or not meme. I made this as a side project to further integrate it with a scrapper so that it can auto identify the memes on my wall and re share it .

2.5k in training set and 800 in testing set.

Loss after 10 epoch was 1.67*10^-7 I believe

I used a normal CNN for this.A working classifier is saved in that can be directly used to classify without retraining.

More work needs to be done.
